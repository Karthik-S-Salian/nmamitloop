II. Consider the following relations for an order processing database application in a company:

CUSTOMER (cust #: int, cname: string, city: string)
ORDER (order #: int, odate: date, cust #: int, ord-Amt: int)
ORDER â€“ ITEM (order #: int, item #: int, qty: int)
ITEM (item #: int, unit price: int)
SHIPMENT (order #: int, warehouse#: int, ship-date: date)
WAREHOUSE (warehouse #: int, city: string)

1. Produce a listing: CUSTNAME, #oforders, AVG_ORDER_AMT, where the middle column is the total numbers of orders by the customer and the last column is the average order amount for that customer.
2. For each item that has more than two orders , list the item, number of orders that are shipped from atleast two warehouses and total quantity of items shipped
3. List the customers who have ordered for every item that the company produces
