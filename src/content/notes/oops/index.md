## Lab Programs

1. [Build a program called “GuessMyNumber”. The computer will generate a
random number between 1 and 10. The user types in a number and the computer
replies “lower” if the random number is lower than the guess, “higher” if the
random number is higher , and “correct!” if the guess is correct. The player can continue guessing until the guess is right.](/nmamitloop/notes/subjects/oops/lab/guess)
