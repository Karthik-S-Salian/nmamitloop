## Theory

## Lab Programs

1. [Implement a shell program to find and display the largest and smallest of three numbers.](/nmamitloop/notes/subjects/unix/lab/program-1)

2. [Find whether the number n is divisible by m or not using a shell script. Where m and n are supplied as command line arguments or read from the keyboard interactively.](/nmamitloop/notes/subjects/unix/lab/program-2)

3. [Plan and implement a shell program to search a pattern in a file that will take both the pattern and file name from the command line arguments.](/nmamitloop/notes/subjects/unix/lab/program-3)

4. [Write a shell program to implement simple calculator operations.](/nmamitloop/notes/subjects/unix/lab/program-4)

5. [Design a Shell Program that takes any number of arguments and prints them in the same order and in reverse order with suitable messages.](/nmamitloop/notes/subjects/unix/lab/program-5)

6. [Design a shell program that takes two file names and checks if the permissions for these files are identical. If they are identical, output the common permissions; otherwise, output each file name followed by its permissions.](/nmamitloop/notes/subjects/unix/lab/program-6)

7. [For the given path names (e.g., a/b, a/b/c), design a shell script to create all the components in those path names as directories.](/nmamitloop/notes/subjects/unix/lab/program-7)

8. [Develop a shell script that performs the following string handling operations:a.  Calculate the length of the string. b. Locate a position of a character in a string c. Extract the first three characters from the string d.Extract the last three characters from the string.](/nmamitloop/notes/subjects/unix/lab/program-8)

9. [For every filename, check whether the file exists in the current directory or not and then convert its name to uppercase only if a file with the new name doesnâ€™t exist. Shell script to perform this task.](/nmamitloop/notes/subjects/unix/lab/program-9)
